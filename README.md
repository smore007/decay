# Decay

An example of a "hacked client" for Minecraft 1.12 with MCP. This is in no way reflective of my actual client... Mods (modules/cheats) are not inlcluded in this repo except for fly and a proof-of-concept arrow-dodger. Event system was an early WIP and can be easily improved.

Due to copyright issues I can't provide where the events should be called from. However if you can't figure that out you shouldn't be creating a "hacked client."
